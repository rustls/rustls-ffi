# Rustls-FFI

This package contains bindings for using rustls in a non-Rust language. If
you're looking at this on crates.io, [you may want the rustls crate
instead](https://crates.io/crates/rustls).

Even though this is a non-Rust API, it is published on crates.io so other
crates that wrap a different non-Rust API (for instance: the curl crate
wraps libcurl) can depend on it.

[You may also want to read the rustls-ffi README](https://github.com/rustls/rustls-ffi#rustls-ffi-bindings).

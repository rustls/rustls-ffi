[features]
# Enable this feature when building as Rust dependency. It inhibits the
# default behavior of capturing the global logger, which only works when
# built using the Makefile, which passes -C metadata=rustls-ffi to avoid
# interfering with copies of the global logger brought in by other Rust
# libraries.

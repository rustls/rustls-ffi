 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 * acceptor: The rustls_acceptor to read bytes into.
 * callback: A function that will perform the actual network I/O.
 *   Must be valid to call with the given userdata parameter until
 *   this function call returns.
 * userdata: An opaque parameter to be passed directly to `callback`.
 *   Note: this is distinct from the `userdata` parameter set with

 * out_n: An output parameter. This will be passed through to `callback`,

 *
 * Returns:
